Read [this](https://coligo.io/javascript-promises-plain-simple/) blog post and [this](https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-javascript-promises-pt-i-background-basics) blog post.

Make sure to save the exercises from the Frontend Masters course:

- [ ] Callback exercise 1 is completed and saved to a file in your repo.

- [ ] Promises exercises 3-6 are completed and saved to a file in your repo.

If you complete the above with time to spare, fill any gaps in your understanding by skimming through the [Promises Course][promises-course] on Udacity.

### Day 3 & 4

Complete exercises 1-13 in the [promise-it-wont-hurt-solutions][promise-it-wont-hurt-solutions].

- [X] `src/01-warmup.js` is complete and written to the appropriate file.
- [X] `src/02-fullfill-a-promise.js` is complete and written to the appropriate file.
- [X] `src/03-reject-a-promise.js` is complete and written to the appropriate file.
- [X] `src/04-to-reject-or-not-to-reject.js` is complete and written to the appropriate file.

- [ ] `src/08-values-and-promises.js` is complete and written to the appropriate file.
- [ ] `src/09-throw-an-error.js` is complete and written to the appropriate file. _\*see note below_

\*Note: `promise-it-wont-hurt` has a bug which checks the full path of the files, instead of the relative paths. This causes exercise 9 & 10's verify command to fail even though the solution is correct. If the file path is the only error that you are seeing, it means that your code is correct.
